//In Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, the `fork()` system call is used to create a new process, which is called a child process. The `fork()` system call creates a new process by duplicating the existing process. After the `fork()` call, both the parent and the child processes continue execution from the next instruction following the `fork()` call. The `fork()` system call is specific to Unix-like operating systems and may not work on Windows. The `fork()` system call is a basic building block for creating new processes in Unix-like operating systems, and it is used extensively in process management and multitasking.
