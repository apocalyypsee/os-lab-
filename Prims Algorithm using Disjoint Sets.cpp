//Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary node and grows the MST by adding the shortest edge that connects the tree to a vertex not yet in the tree. This process is repeated until all vertices are included in the MST. A disjoint set data structure is used to keep track of partitions or disjoint sets of elements. It provides two main operations:Union: Merge two sets& Find: Determine which set an element belongs to.
